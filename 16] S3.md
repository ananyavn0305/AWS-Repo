## Easy Level

1. **What is Amazon S3?**  
   S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere.

2. **What is a bucket in S3?**  
   A bucket is a container in S3 where objects (files) are stored. You can create up to 100 buckets per AWS account.

3. **Rules for bucket naming?**  
   - Globally unique  
   - 3–63 characters  
   - Only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and periods (.)  
   - Start and end with a lowercase letter or number  
   - Cannot look like IP addresses

4. **What is an object in S3?**  
   An object is the entity stored in a bucket, consisting of data and metadata. Each object is identified by a key.

5. **Maximum size of an S3 object?**  
   5 Terabytes (TB)

6. **What is a key in S3?**  
   The unique identifier for an object within a bucket.

## Moderate Level

7. **What is versioning in S3?**  
   Versioning keeps multiple variations of an object in the same bucket, allowing recovery from accidental deletion or overwrite.

8. **What happens when you delete an object in a versioned bucket?**  
   S3 adds a delete marker as the current version; the actual object still exists and can be restored.

9. **Name S3 storage classes.**  
   - Standard  
   - Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)  
   - One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)  
   - Intelligent-Tiering  
   - Glacier  
   - Glacier Deep Archive

10. **Use case for S3 Standard?**  
    Frequently accessed data requiring high durability and low latency.

11. **Use case for Standard-IA?**  
    Less frequently accessed data, like backups or disaster recovery files.

12. **Use case for One Zone-IA?**  
    Secondary backups or easily re-creatable data, infrequently accessed.

13. **What is S3 Intelligent-Tiering?**  
    Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers to optimize cost without affecting performance.

14. **Use case for S3 Glacier?**  
    Long-term archival storage with retrieval times from minutes to hours.

15. **Use case for Glacier Deep Archive?**  
    Extremely low-cost long-term storage for rarely accessed data with retrieval times up to 12 hours.

## Hard Level / Scenario-Based

16. **Scenario: You need to store media files for a web app that are frequently accessed. Which S3 class?**  
    Use **S3 Standard** for high availability and low-latency access.

17. **Scenario: Backup data that is rarely accessed but must be quickly retrievable.**  
    Use **S3 Standard-IA** for lower storage costs with rapid access when needed.

18. **Scenario: Secondary backups that can tolerate being in a single AZ.**  
    Use **S3 One Zone-IA** for cost savings.

19. **Scenario: Data with unpredictable access patterns.**  
    Use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** to automatically move objects between tiers for cost optimization.

20. **Scenario: Long-term archival of regulatory data with infrequent access.**  
    Use **S3 Glacier** for low-cost archival with retrieval times in minutes to hours.

21. **Scenario: Long-term archival of rarely accessed data with minimal storage cost.**  
    Use **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** for the lowest storage cost, retrieval up to 12 hours.

22. **Scenario: Accidental deletion of an object in a versioned bucket. What can you do?**  
    Restore the previous version since versioning preserves all object versions.

23. **Scenario: You want to optimize cost without affecting performance for changing access patterns.**  
    Enable **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**, which automatically transitions objects between frequent and infrequent tiers.

24. **Scenario: Need to ensure global uniqueness of bucket names.**  
    Follow S3 bucket naming rules: globally unique, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens, 3–63 chars, not IP-formatted.

25. **Scenario: You need to store large datasets, possibly in TBs. Which S3 class is suitable?**  
    All S3 storage classes support objects up to **5 TB**; choose the class based on access pattern and cost requirements.
